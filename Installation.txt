INSTALLATION

1. Add the "barcodes" directory to /catalog/admin/.
2. Add the font file "arialbd.ttf" to /catalog/admin/barcodes.  This file is rather large (9728kb), so
   it's not included with the contribution package.  Most computers with Microsoft Office will have this
   file.  Conversely, you can find it freely available on the web, including here:

	http://www.paulsymansky.com/usps:start
 
3. Modify "packingslip.php" in /catalog/admin/.
	a. If your "packingslip.php" file isn't modified, simply overwrite the file on your
	  server with the supplied "packingslip.php" file in this contribution.

	b. If your file is modified, you will need to add these three lines of code:

		<!-- BOF Barcode Modification - line 39 //-->

		<br><img src="barcodes/barcode.php?oID=<?php echo $oID;?>">
		
		<!-- EOF Barcode Modification //-->	

			After this, near line 38:

		<td><table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

			<tr>

				<td class="pageHeading"><?php echo nl2br(STORE_NAME_ADDRESS); ?></td>

				<td class="pageHeading" align="right"><?php echo tep_image(DIR_WS_IMAGES . 'oscommerce.gif', 'osCommerce', '204', '50'); ?></td>

4. Run "setup.sql" in your database.  You can run it in your osCommerce database, or a new one.
   In either case, make sure you know your login credentials.

5. Open "bc_db_query.php" and supply the correct login information for your osCommerce database.
   Beneath that, supply the login information for the database containing the new tables created 
   by the "setup.sql" script.  If this database is the same as your osCommerce database, provide 
   the same login information again.

6. Install "bc_db_query.php" somewhere on your web server.  Make a note of the location.  We recommend
   placing the file in a protected directory (basic HTTP authentication). As of version 2.0.0 of this
   add-on, bc_db_query.php requires PHP5+. Certain servers running multiple versions of PHP will execute
   scripts using PHP5 by changing the file extension (e.g. ".php5" instead of ".php") or modifying the
   .htaccess file.

7. Install the Firefox add-on by dragging "barcodeshipping.xpi" into Firefox.
	a. Follow the prompts to finish the installation.

8. In Firefox, access the add-on's option menu by following this path:

	Tools > Add-ons > Barcode USPS Module > Options

	General tab:

		a. Enter the location of the "bc_db_query.php" script on your server 
		   using this format: "http://www.examples.com/directory/"

		b. If the script is in a protected directory, provide the login name and password 
		   and check the box directly beneath.

		c. If your barcode scanner reads the checksum digit (the final digit, not a part
		   of your order number), be sure to check the box marked "Remove checksum digit?".

		d. If you regularly ship packages from somewhere other than the return address,
		   enter the new zip code andcheck the box marked "Use alternate origin ZIP code?".

	USPS tab:
		a. (optional) If you would like the add-on to automatically log in and take you
		   to the label form, provide your USPS login username and password.

		b. (optional) If you would like the add-on to automatically add batch labels to 
		   a batch, check the box marked "Automatically submit batch label form?".

		c. (optional) If you would like the add-on to automatically populate the credit 
		   card security code (CVV) field, provide your card's CVV number and check the 
		   box marked "Automatically populated CVV number?".  Take note that this function
		   will only populate the CVV field for the first listed credit card. Check the 
		   box marked "Automatically submit payment form?" to automatically submit this 
		   form as well.

		d. (optional) If you would like the add-on to automatically agree to USPS's 
		   domestic and international shipping terms, select the appropriate boxes under 
		   "Confirmation Information."  You may choose to omit the receipt and shipping 
		   instructions from the labels and automatically submit this form here too.

	Customs tab: 

		a. (optional) If you would like the add-on to automatically populate the customs 
		   form for international labels, provide the details of your package's contents.  
		   Be sure to check the box marked "Automatically populate customs form?".  This 
		   feature only currently supports single item shipments and products manufactured 
		   in the United States.
		
			i. It is possible to change the country of origin by modifying the 
			   following file: 
                   	
				Chrome://defaults/preferences/prefs.js

9. (optional) Right-click on the toolbar in Firefox and select "Customize...".  Now find the USPS logo
   and drag it to your toolbar.  Clicking this logo will take you straight to the label form, or the
   login page if you haven't provided your username and password.  

10. You're all set!  Click the USPS icon or navigate to the USPS Click-N-Ship label form.  Using a 
   plug-and-play/HID barcode scanner, scan the barcode on your packing slip.  The form should 
   automatically be populated with the corresponding order information.


UPGRADE
 
1. Run "setup.sql" in the same database you originally used.

2. Open "bc_db_query.php" and supply the correct login information for your osCommerce database.
   Beneath that, supply the login information for the database containing the new tables created 
   by the "setup.sql" script.  If this database is the same as your osCommerce database, provide 
   the same login information again.

3. Overwrite the copy of "bc_db_query.php" on your web server with the new one. As of version 2.0.0 of this
   add-on, bc_db_query.php requires PHP5+. Certain servers running multiple versions of PHP will execute
   scripts using PHP5 by changing the file extension (e.g. ".php5" instead of ".php") or modifying the
   .htaccess file.

4. Install the updated Firefox add-on by dragging "barcodeshipping.xpi" into Firefox.
	a. Follow the prompts to finish the installation.

5. The other files have not changed since the module was first written. The Firefox add-on's settings
   should carry over, but please verify them anyway.
